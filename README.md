# Task 6: Subqueries and Nested Queries

## Objective
Learn to use subqueries in `SELECT`, `WHERE`, and `FROM` clauses to build advanced SQL query logic.

## Tools
- DB Browser for SQLite  
- MySQL Workbench  

## Deliverables
SQL queries with nested logic (`task6.sql`)

---

## Hints / Mini Guide
1. Use **scalar subqueries** (return a single value).  
2. Use **correlated subqueries** (depend on outer query).  
3. Apply subqueries inside `IN`, `EXISTS`, `=`.  
4. Use subqueries in `FROM` as **derived tables**.  

---

## Example Queries Included
- **Subquery in SELECT** → Show customer with total orders.  
- **Subquery in WHERE (IN)** → Customers with orders > 500.  
- **Subquery in WHERE (EXISTS)** → Customers who placed at least one order.  
- **Subquery in FROM** → Customers with their average order amount.  
- **Subquery with "="** → Customer who placed the highest order.

## Outcome
✔ Learned scalar and correlated subqueries  
✔ Practiced nested queries in `SELECT`, `WHERE`, and `FROM`  
✔ Improved **advanced query logic skills**
